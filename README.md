# API snapshotting with JEST

This is a working example of how to test API endpoints with JEST snapshotting. Tests start a backend server, execute a GET and a POST test, and then shutdown the server.

The POST test is sanitized with a Lodash call  in order to avoid the snapshotting test failing due to autogenerated values.

# Project Structure
- database folder: mongo.js is used to create and shutdown a in-memory Mongo database and ads.js is used to insert/update/delete/get from the database.
- server.js contains the necessary calls to create and shutdown an Express app that will be the target application to run the Jest tests against.
- test folder: contains the __snapshots__ folder and the Jest demo spec with the GET and POST tests.
